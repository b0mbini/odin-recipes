        <h3> The Story You Have to Scroll Through Before You Can Read My Recipe</h3>
        <p>When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band. He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?" He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made? Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer to join in the black parade."</p>
        <p>And I said, "I'm going to live with mom full-time."</p>
        <p>Anyway, here's this shepherd's pie recipe I've spent 20 years perfecting! If you make it with any changes, I'll know, and <strong>I'll come to your house and cry.</strong> And you won't be able to get rid of me. Like that sad clown in the original Sims.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients, Allegedly</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Uhhh...beef? Or lamb. Or both, I don't know.</li>
            <li>Potatoes for sure, a bunch of 'em</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce. I know this, because when I made this, literally everyone was out of f**king Worcestershire sauce. Because it was almost St. Patrick's day, so everyone was making this, I guess, and I can't make fun of them, because I was, too.</li>
            <li>Peas.</li>
            <li>Carrots.</li>
            <li>Other vegetables, if you want. I refuse.</li>
            <li>Gordon Ramsay uses red wine. I didn't, and then I wished I had.</li>
            <li>Corn...starch? Flour? Idk, some sort of powder</li>
            <li>I'm SURE butter is involved</li>
            <li>garlic powder.....other spices? oh, thyme and stuff. bay leaf? no, you'd have to fish it out. rosemary!!!</li>
            <li>salt!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You should DEFINITELY cook the meat. Do that.</li>
            <li>I bought pre-made mashed potatoes at wegman's because it was ergonomic.</li>
            <li>You should put the spices and stuff in the meat. Maybe you should have done that first?</li>
            <li>Oh, what you SHOULD have done first is chop the vegetables and stuff. Unless you bought them pre-chopped. Oh shit, onions should be in the ingredients list. Oh, well. Go buy some onions. Turn the stove off first.</li>
            <li>Yellow onion, obviously.</li>
            <li>Red onion would be insane.</li>
            <li>Some people sweat their onions down, but I don't know what that means. Every time someone says that, it just looks like they're cooking them to me. Just say that.</li>
            <li>Uhh...put the vegetables in there.</li>
            <li>Put the mashed potatoes on top.</li>
            <li>Realize you didn't buy enough mashed potatoes. Spread 'em real thin. Hold head in hands.</li>
            <li>Put in turned-on oven.</li>
            <li>Wait.</li>
            <li>Take it out of the oven. Observe the places where the fat burst through the very thin layer of potatoes.</li>
            <li>Be assured by your mom that it looks great.</li>
            <li>Try to serve. Why is it soup? Shouldn't you be able to cut into it? Well, it's soup with potatoes on top of it, now.</li>
            <li>Eat it. Realize it does taste acceptable. Hooray! You did it. Probably.</li>
        </ol>
