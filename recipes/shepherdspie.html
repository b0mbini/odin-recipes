        <h3>The Story You Have to Scroll Through Before You Can Read My Recipe</h3>
        <p>When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band. He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?" He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made? Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer to join in the black parade."</p>
        <p>And I said, "I'm going to live with mom full-time."</p>
        <p>Anyway, here's this shepherd's pie recipe I've spent 20 years perfecting! If you make it with any changes, I'll know, and I'll come to your house and cry! And you won't be able to get rid of me. Like that sad clown in the original Sims.</p>
